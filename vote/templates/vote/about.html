		<h1>The Parable of the Two Doors</h1>

		<p id='' class='mt-5'>A young man, troubled by a great decision, sought the wisdom of an elder. He found the old man sitting beneath a gnarled tree, its branches twisting like the paths of life.</p>

		<p class=''>"Elder," the young man began, "I stand before two doors. One is marked 'Yes,' the other 'No.' Each leads to a different future, and I fear choosing wrongly. How can I know which door to take?"</p>

		<p class=''>The elder smiled and said, "Tell me, what do you see when you stand before these doors?"

		<p class=''>The young man replied, "Behind 'Yes,' I see a path of light, but it is steep and uncertain. Behind 'No,' I see a flat road, but it is shadowed and dull. I am torn, for I desire both the light and the ease."

		<p class=''>The elder nodded and plucked a leaf from the tree. "This leaf," he said, "does not choose whether to fall or stay. It trusts the wind to carry it where it must go. Yet, you are not a leaf. You have the gift of choice, and with it, the burden of consequence."

		<p class=''>"But how do I choose?" the young man pressed. "What if I regret my decision?"

		<p class=''>The elder handed him the leaf. "Regret is not the enemy of choice; fear is. Fear whispers that one path is right and the other wrong, but life is not so simple. Each door leads to joy and sorrow, growth and struggle. The question is not which door to choose, but who you will become as you walk through it."

		<p class=''>The young man looked at the leaf in his hand, then at the elder. "So it does not matter which door I choose?"

		<p class=''>"It matters deeply," the elder said. "But not because one door is right and the other wrong. It matters because the act of choosing shapes you. To say 'Yes' is to embrace the unknown. To say 'No' is to honor your limits. Both are sacred if chosen with intention."

		<p class=''>The young man stood silently, weighing the elder's words. At last, he said, "I understand now. The difficulty is not in choosing the door, but in choosing myself."

		<p class=''>The elder smiled. "Go, then. Walk through the door that calls to you, and do not look back. For the true journey begins not on the path, but in the heart of the one who walks it."

		<p class=''>And with that, the young man turned and walked toward the doors, the leaf still clasped in his hand, ready to embrace whatever lay beyond.
